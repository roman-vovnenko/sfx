> 1. Create a simple navbar component and put it in the main page

Done.

> 2. Add the "Userform" component into the main appi

The form was already on the page and it is working.
So I am not sure if I have to implement a proper UX/UI or just keep it working?

> 3. Create an API to fetch users to mongodb database

Done.

> 4. Create a list or table to show all the users in the database

Done. Can be seen at
