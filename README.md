1. Create a simple navbar component and put it in the main page
2. Add the "Userform" component into the main app
3. Create an API to fetch users to mongodb database
4. Create a list or table to show all the users in the database

Regarding the second task you mentioned, adding the Userform component to the main app appears to already be done based on the current structure.
